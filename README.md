### plan 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

I plan to integrate the fireworks scene from the “Harry Potter” films into the project. These fireworks are not just visually stunning landscapes; they also symbolize wonder and magic, resonating emotionally with the audience. I believe it's a beneficial technique. Because fireworks have brilliant colours, their dynamic movement and sparkle also offer the visual richness and dynamics required for the assignment. Additionally, the fireworks scene enhances interactivity and allure, while also offering a high degree of customization and flexibility. By triggering effects interactively, it further enhances engagement and enjoyment.

### Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

Create different types of fireworks with colors inspired by the magic of Harry Potter, such as red, green, and blue. Utilize the Particle and Firework classes to construct a particle system, where each particle represents a spark and each firework object represents the entire firework. After clicking the mouse, use the mousePressed() function to create a new Firework object and add it to the particles array.. In the Firework class, initialize the firework as particles moving upwards, randomize the speed and colour, and set a countdown time. When the timer ends, the firework will explode into multiple sparks.
